2023-11-03 01:56:02,872 - CRITICAL - Failed to launch the interface: Queue needs to be enabled! You may get this error by either 1) passing a function that uses the yield keyword into an interface without enabling the queue or 2) defining an event that cancels another event without enabling the queue. Both can be solved by calling .queue() before .launch()
